                        Discovering Computer Science
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Computer science was not something I had planned to pursue.  Before entering high school, I had never taken a
                         programming course and had only experimented with small projects in Scratch.  In my sophomore year of high 
                         school, I decided to take AP Computer Science Principles because I had heard that it was an AP course that 
                         gave an approachable introduction to programming.  While taking AP CSP, I found my passion for coding.  I 
                         loved the way it made me think about creative and efficient solutions to problems.  In the past, I had always 
                         gravitated towards STEM classes because I could think logically and find patterns, and computer science aligned 
                         perfectly while still allowing me to be creative.

                        I continued to take the computer science classes available at my high school, completing AP Computer Science A 
                        and a Python programming course before I graduated.  When researching colleges, I looked for computer science 
                        programs that would still allow me to have a well-rounded education.  I chose UC Berkeley’s Computer Science 
                        major in the College of Letters and Science because I had the freedom to pursue computer science within a liberal 
                        arts program.

                    <p>
                        The breadth of courses in the College of Letters and Science has enabled me to major in Computer Science with a
                         minor in Public Policy.  I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and policy, specifically cybersecurity,
                          and enjoy learning about how technology can be leveraged to promote equitable policies that address those who 
                          need them most.

                        My goal with this site is to share my unique experience as a Computer Science student at UC Berkeley, which 
                        has been influenced by remote learning and my status as an underrepresented gender group in computer science.  
                        I want to encourage others to get involved with programming, whether in school or for fun, and to highlight 
                        that everyone’s experience with computer science is different.  I have also learned new skills and tools working 
                        in the tech industry that I want to share with others.  I look forward to continuing to share my experiences 
                        through this blog with some exciting topics to come!
